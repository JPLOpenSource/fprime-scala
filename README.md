# F' (F Prime) in Scala

The contents of this repository is an implementation of a small subset of the F' (F Prime) framework in the Scala programming language. 

## Caveats

The implementation is not at this point documented well, neither in the form of user manual, nor in the form of actual code documentation. The currently best way to comprehend the code is to look at the examples in the test directory. Documentation will follow. Example number 11 is the most substantial example, deploying components, hiearchical state machines and temporal monitors.
