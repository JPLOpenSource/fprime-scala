# F' (F Prime) in Scala

The contents of this repository is a Scala DSL of a component-based framework for software development consiting to three components, all of which can be used together.

## F' (F Prime) 

A small subset of the framework developed in C++ and described in the following paper, which has been the basis for the Scala implementation (see papers/fprime folder):

*  **F Prime: An Open-Source Framework for Small-Scale Flight Software Systems**,   Robert L. Bocchino Jr., Timothy K. Canham, Garth J. Watney, Leonard J. Reder,

## HSM (Hiearchical State Machines)

A Scala DSL for writing hiearchical state machines. The DSL is described in the paper
(see papers/hsm folder):
