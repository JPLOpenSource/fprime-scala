 * The QTL (Quantified Temporal Logic) DSL is effectively the

 * only as a jar file. See the website above for further documentation.
 *
 * DejaVu is capable of online monitoring but is originally script-wise set up for log file analysis.
 * Incorporating DejaVu into an F' component is doable at a prototyping level, but the process can be
 * improved.
